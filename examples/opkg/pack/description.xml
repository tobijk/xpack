    <summary>OPKG - tiny yet powerful package manager</summary>
    <p>
        Opkg is a lightweight package management system. It is written in C and resembles
    apt/dpkg in operation. It is intended for use on embedded Linux devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Opkg is maintained, stable, robust and conservative in its memory usage. As best it
    can, opkg maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and conforms to a subset of
    Debian's Policy Manual regarding control files.

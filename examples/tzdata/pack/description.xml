    <summary>time zone and daylight-saving time data</summary>
    <p>
        This package contains data required for the implementation of
    standard local time for many representative locations around the
    globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by
    political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and
    daylight-saving rules.
